## Overview of the project
### Project: SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
### Objective:
**The objective of Amazon review sentiment analysis is to determine the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) expressed in customer reviews to gain insights into product performance, customer satisfaction, and areas for improvement. This helps businesses make data-driven decisions to enhance products, services, and customer experiences.** 

### Key Activities: 
**Data Loading:** 

Reads the dataset into a DataFrame.

**Preprocessing:** 

Cleans and tokenizes the text data, converts labels to numeric format.

**Model Architecture:**

**Embedding layer:** Converts words into dense vectors.

**BiLSTM layers:** Captures contextual information in both directions.

**Dense layers:** Final classification layers.

**Training:**

Trains the model using binary cross-entropy loss for a binary classification task.

**Prediction:**

Demonstrates prediction on a sample review.

**Training History Visualization:**

Plots both training and validation accuracy over epochs.

Plots both training and validation loss over epochs.

**Visualization with Matplotlib:**

Creates a side-by-side comparison of accuracy and loss to evaluate model performance.


### Technologies Used:
**Python:** Programming language

**Pandas:** Used for data manipulation

**numpy:** Used for mathematical calculations
